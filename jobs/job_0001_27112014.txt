Job #0001, dated 27/11/2014:

-- Applying Coding Conventions --

We have agreed on the following coding conventions for this project:

wo_code_conv (shared with WymonOrion Gmail account)

NOTE: Please do read the coding conventions once again, because some additions
have been made.

Now those coding conventions have to be applied to each and every code file 
inside the repository. The following parts have to be dealt with separately:

NOTE: The sections with headings inside the double #-signs can be dealt with
in any order. BUT within the sections, each file has to be dealt with in the
order of occurrence, because they build up on each other.

## utils ##

-) Time_string (/incl and /src, NOTE: rename to "time_str")
-) Unicode (/incl and /src)

## graphics ##

-) texturable (/incl and /src, NOTE: the class HAS TO be called "texturable")
-) sprite (/incl and /src)
-) texture_repository (/incl and /src)

In addition to that, please insert the "Exhibit A" from the Mozilla Public
License v2.0 at the start of every file AFTER you have applied the
coding conventions. That way, we can tell whether or not a file is finished.

Here is the "Exhibit A", already prepared to be copied at the start of the
file:

* This Source Code Form is subject to the terms of the Mozilla Public License,
* v.2.0. If a copy of the MPL was not distributed with this file, You can 
* obtain one at http://mozilla.org/MPL/2.0/.
*/

After you have done your work, stage the files, write a commit with the
commit message telling which part you modified and push it on the server.
Please just use YOUR personal branch, not the master branch.

In this list below you can write down your name and which part you want to
work on:
